So your mission if you choose to accept it is. I need 87 init lines made for these tiles that do not have inits. I don't really understand how to make inits so this will really help me out.
Thank you again for you help/attempt at doing this 

What do you getn out of it 

You get to be credited and thanked by me 

Where to store the homemade inits 

I created a txt for that called Homemade inits

DM me at @solaristheworstcatever

Good luck!!!
